# MAKERTEENS
 
## Promotes High School Graduation and College and Career Readiness

 > The goal of Oregon's Measure 98 is to "support the needs of students related to engagement, personalization, achievement, and college and career readiness." 

More than a drop-out prevention program, the MAKERTEENS Alternative Education Career Academy model offers students college credit and career readiness skills as they complete a well-rounded theme-based curriculum and build a Tiny House in one school year. Any high school student may apply, but preference is given to Klamath Falls City School District students who have completed Algebra I but may have risk factors.

**Proposal for Full Year Program**  

Provide a dozen high school students the opportunity to build a tiny house on a trailer frame. This same MAKERTEENS cadre will be mentored through classes such as: 

- Integrated Science
- Construction Math
- Geometry
- English Language Arts
- Spanish
- AP Psychology
- AP Studio Art
- Band 
- Health/PE
- Family and Consumer Science 
- Media (Web Design, Videography)
- Welding

Students in a project-based, intense mentorship, along with job shadowing in the community, and parent engagement, will effectively move toward a diploma, personal success, and job skills. Additionally, students may earn badges and certificates in industry recognized proficiencies.

**MAKERTEENS practice Oregon’s 21 Century Essential Skills:**

- Read and comprehend a variety of text

- Apply mathematics in a variety of settings 
- Listen actively and speak clearly and coherently
- Think critically and analytically
