# MAKERTEENS
 
## Promotes High School Graduation and College and Career Readiness

 > The goals of Oregon's Measure 98 is to "support the needs of students related to engagement, personalization, achievement, and college and career readiness." 

More than a drop-out prevention program, the MAKERTEENS school within a school Career Academy model offers students college credit and career readiness skills as they complete a well rounded curriculum and build a Tiny House in one school year.

**Proposal**  
Provide a dozen at-risk high school students the opportunity to build a tiny house on a trailer frame. This same MAKERTEENS cadre will be mentored through the following classes: Family and Consumer Science, AP Studio Art, AP Psychology, Web Design, Band, Integrated Science, Language Arts, Health/PE, Construction Math. This well-rounded, project-based, intense mentorship, along with job shadowing in the community, and parent engagement, will effectively move a student toward a diploma, personal success, and job skills. Additionally, students may earn badges and certificates in industry recognized proficiencies.
