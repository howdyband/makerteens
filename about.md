**Proposal** for a self-contained, alternatve school within a school program

Provide a dozen at-risk high school students the opportunity to build a tiny house on a trailer frame. This same MAKERTEENS cadre will be mentored through the following classes by one highly qualified teacher: Family and Consumer Science, AP Studio Art, AP Psychology, Web Design, Band, Integrated Science, Language Arts, Construction Math.  This well-rounded, project-based, intense mentorship, along with job shadowing in the community, and parent engagement, will effectively move a student toward a diploma, personal success, and job skills. Additionally, students may earn badges and certificates in industry recognized proficiencies. 

**Rational** why this program is needed

Evidence suggests smaller learning communities can boost student achievement, improve attendance rates, decrease disciplinary referrals, and raise self-esteem. (Kemple, 2006)

In the typical 40 hour week workplace, a supervisor manages a group of workers, all day, all week. There is no “falling through the cracks” as one worker shuffles between 5 or more supervisors during a work day like in a large high school. A quietly sullen student could go undetected the full day, a passive-aggressive student could balance a shoulder chip for 50 minutes as the teacher avoided conflict. A class clown could deflect responsibility or feign incompetence for a short disruptive period, with all actors relieved knowing that the gig will soon be up. These practiced behaviors function to evade work. Students at-risk hide in fear of being rejected, covertly pleading to be known and respected an adult. A full day with the same teacher greatly diminishes student ability to smoke screen fears and weaknesses. Although initially painful and time consuming, the results are worth the effort. Under continuous, intensive, relentless care, pretenses fall away, authenticity surfaces, and the whole person can be rehabilitated, in the truest sense of forming beneficial habits.

Additionally, viable cross-curricular project-based learning is more feasible and coherent when delivered by the same teacher who strategically integrates learning opportunities within the dynamic flow of group and individual needs. This relevant education, within a positive environment aimed to meet individual needs, will diminish the frequency of students who feel alienated and disengaged from school. A smaller learning community strengthens relationships.

This alternative school provides the IEP team with another possible least restrictive environment (LRE) in their continuum of placement options. The U.S. Department of Education defines an alternative education school as ”a public elementary/secondary school that addresses the needs of students which typically cannot be met in a regular school and provides nontraditional education which is not categorized solely as regular education, special education, vocational education, gifted and talented or magnet school programs” (U.S. Department of Education, 2002, p. 55).

The alternative education teacher is not a lone ranger but is seen as a team member who collaborates by blending RTI (Response to Intervention) and individual PBIS student supports and interventions for students with significant behavioral needs in the wraparound planning process. 

**Potential Barriers**

A self-contained alternative education program within a traditional school has the intrinsic danger of stigma. Additionally, the risk factors from inappropriate peer associations may be compounded. Disengagement with “normal” school activities can accelerate the tendency to drop out of school. A concentration of impulsive youth with negative attitudes can feed on each other in an escalation of poor behaviors and general rebelliousness. For the uninitiated, being regularly exposed to delinquency may be a gateway to illicit substance abuse, pornography, foul language, and a host of other behaviors in a type of prison yard training ground. Teacher awareness of such potential to downward spiral, empowers the teacher to nip problems in the bud, redirect negative energy, maintain firm expectations  and supports for success, and immediately trouble shoot the function of counter-productive behaviors by collaborating with parents, colleagues, and students as appropriate.

**Philosophy of Education**

According to social constructivist theory, the group defines the paradigms of reality and sets expectations. A purely discovery based constructivist approach is inefficient use of time and makes ineffectual progress. The romantic notion that students can solely guide themselves is rejected. However, with training, students move toward self-directed group discussion within a context of mutual respect and encouragement from academic teammates. Likewise, individuals are given strategies for self-monitored productive learning. 

**Myths** to change behavior:
1. Education creates behavior change (No, Information is not enough.) Information needs to be tangible, personalized, and interactive.
2. You need to change attitudes in order to change behaviors. (No, behaviors change attitudes, not typically the other way around.)
3. People know what motivates them to take action (No, social scientist know social norms are the most powerful influence. 

It is not a myth that well structured learning environments offer appropriate scaffolds toward predefined outcomes.

**Accountability** based on roll modeling Habits of Mind and Best Practices

The state of North Carolina (Public Schools of North Carolina, 2001) did a longitudinal, in-depth evaluation of their alternative education programs spanning more than five years. Their findings are similar to those of other researchers. According to this report, successful alternative education schools have the following characteristics:
* Strong sense of purpose and mission
* Caring and committed staff
* Dynamic leadership
* Collegiality with faculty and students
* Family-like atmosphere of respect
* Low teacher/student ratio allowing more individual attention
* Hands-on/experiential learning
* Individualized and personalized learning
* Emotional, physical, and academic needs of students addressed
* Flexibility
* Focus on academic standards
* Creative strategies for course offerings
* Significant parent involvement
* Strong community connections. 

In addition to itemizing time and expenses as per state requirements, student progress toward program goals is regularly assessed. Data which identified an at-risk student, such as truancy, low grades, and office referrals, are collected and evaluated. Baseline data is provided by those who are aware of student history and likely trajectory without effective intervention. In collaboration with the school counselor, administrator, parent, and community services, individualized outcomes are identified, tracked, and reported. 

**Attendance Laws**

ORS 339.010 School attendance required; age limits. Except as provided in ORS 339.030, all children between the ages of 7 and 18 years who have not completed the 12th grade are required to attend regularly a public full time school of the school district in which the child resides. 

ORS 339.020 Duty to send children to school. Except as provided in ORS 339.030, every person having control of any child between the ages of 7 and 18 years who have not completed the 12th grade is required to send such child to and maintain such child in regular attendance at a public full time school during the entire school term. Violations are punishable, upon conviction, by a fine of not more than $100 or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 30 days or both. Students who fail to maintain regular attendance in school may have either their driving privileges suspended or the right to apply for driving privileges suspended. Any parent who fails to maintain their child in regular attendance or who fails to send a student to school within three (3) days of notification by the district that their student is not complying with compulsory attendance requirements may be issued a citation by the district for the student's failure to attend school. Violation is a Class C violation of law and is punishable by a court imposed fine up to $150 as provided by ORS 339.925. For the purpose of computing irregular attendance, an unexcused absence for a period during a portion of the day will be considered a half days absence. Additionally, a parent or other person lawfully charged with the care or custody of a student under 15 years of age, may be found by the courts to have committed the offense of failing to supervise a child who has failed to attend school as required. Violations, as determined by the court, may be punishable by a requirement to complete a parent effectiveness program approved by the court and/or a fine of not more than $600.
