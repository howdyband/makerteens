# MAKERTEENS Courses #
 
MakerTeens aligns with Oregon State requirements toward earning a regular diploma, a modified diploma (OAR 581-022-1134), or an alternative certificate (OAR 581-022-1135). MakerTeens prepares students toward proficiency in the essential skills of reading, writing, math, and others listed at https://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/essentialskills/Documents/es_definitions_grad-requirements.pdf . For information about special diploma types, visit https://www.oregon.gov/ode/students-and-family/SpecialEducation/SecondaryTransition/Documents/faqs-2015-transition-book_final2.pdf

MakerTeens, in colaboration with college and school district counselors, offers comprehensive guidance and counseling. 

Asynchronous classes are designed in a pre/post test model that allows credit for demonstration of rigourous and authentic proficiency. https://www.oregon.gov/ode/students-and-family/OregonDiploma/PLR/Pages/Proficiency-Grading.aspx

Students are encouraged to take all of the following courses in a single year of collegial team building under consistent mentorship of a single teacher. However, due to issues of credit recovery in order to stay on track for graduation, a student may exchange out of up to half of the following classes, but must retain commitment to the bus conversion. 

MakerTeens, while not actively involved with the bus conversion, are expected to be working in their asynchronous classes.

**Bus Conversion**

The core career and technical activity is to convert a school bus over the school year. Student teams research, design, and construct a prototype with a materials list for submission to judges. Every student, after passing shop safety tests, helps to build the winning design from weld fabricating the raised roof to finishing with interior design artwork. Technical aspects also include use of solar voltaics, hydraulics, and programing a microcontroller such as an Arduino. Students rotate through the role of crew boss in each phase of construction to meet timelines. Other students document the process in a video blog on our website. The bus is sold to cover costs and contribute to next year's project. Resources: https://skoolie.com and https://tinyhousecommunity.com/building-tips/

Engineering and converting the bus is the vehicle used to display all the participants' growth in other areas. Art, Music, Math, Science, and more join together in this project based experience. The process presents opportunities to experience and direct psychological phenomenon that serve to improve each mind, each character of integrity and perseverance. 

Over the course of 36 weeks, approximately 360 hours are set aside for converting the bus. If 10 students fully participated every available hour, then 3,600 hours would be expended toward project completion. (One highly skilled journeyman could build the same in about 200 hours.) The excess class time includes training in tool safety, job site safety, practice projects, house design and research, drafting in Sketch-up, learning regulations, and best practices of specialty trades, dealing with the permit process, and taking time for teachable moments related to art, math, science, and psychology. Additionally, the videography team sets up shots and lighting for quality documentation.

**AP Studio Art**

Ceramics (with wheel and kiln), sculpture, drawing, painting, silk screen, weaving, photography, making decorative items for the bus conversion...

Another project based learning that cuts across STEAM classes are the knowledge and skills acquired while building a musical instrument. During the year, approximently 60 hours are dedicated to learning and producing a professional quality product. Options are: electric guitar, tuned marimba, hammered dulcimer, pan flute, or other proposals. 
Physics: waves, harmonics… Math: calculating volume of resonating spaces, geometry… Chemistry: finishes… Engineering: design, …

This is the obvious "A" that transforms STEM into STEAM. Art is the creative expression that enhances the meaning of other disciplines. "_The greatest scientists are always artists as well_” ~ Albert Einstein

**AP Psychology**

Included in the curricular scope of psychology are studies  which enable the formation of better study skills, healthier concepts of self, stronger resistance to negative peer influence, and protection from cognitive errors. Students may earn college credit by passing the May exam.

Far more than an opportunity to be awarded college credit for coursework done in high school, psychology increases the understanding of our internal strengths and weaknesses. This awareness is core to empowering the customization of character, forming beneficial habits that displace harmful habits. Awareness of personality traits allow for revision, addition, and even deletion of traits as students build a reputation.

Psychology is to other subjects, such a genetics in the study of traits in psychology, or anatomy and physiology of the nervous system.

**Media** 

MAKERTEENS create websites (HTML, CSS, PHP…) and produce content (videography, interviews, reports) to document Tiny House process, raise support for material donations, and display their digital portfolios. Videography includes using the teacher’s drones (windwhisker.com).

**Band**

Style depends on student interest, ranging from mariachi band to bluegrass to rock. Band performs at the year-end open house party, and other venues if appropriate.

Making music causes deep and enduring changes to brain structure, more than any other activity, that is legal. Studies show increased neural density of musicians verses non-musicians. This allows for faster and more creative problem solving. Various physiological improvements also increase social richness in communication, toleration, and camaraderie. During the year every student learns to play at least one instrument to a competency of being able to harmonize with accurate syncopation while playing in a group of other musicians. Students learn to read and compose music. Original songs which promote the Tiny House project are performed and published on our website.

**Integrated Science**

This course serves as a practical introduction to full courses in biology, physics, and chemistry. Students gain familiarity with the periodic table, chemical compounds and reactions, forces and motion, energy and machines, electromagnetism, waves, and geologic survey related to construction sites, and septic fields. 

Physics as related to construction or how instruments produce sounds. Color theory and frequency of light... all based in the skill set advocated by the Next Generation Science Standards, with scientific inquiry and lab experience.

Science comes first in the STEAM project based model. Scientific thinking is integrated into every aspect of our alternative high school. Students think critically as they research and evaluate the merits of competing ideas. Students test claims and report their findings in concise written and oral communication. The study of physics is most often the focus as we learn about such things as manipulating waves in art and music, and learning why simple and complex machines make human effort more efficient while we build our tiny house. In biology we learn about the dangers of mold and how to prevent its growth inside the tiny house. Within the category of biology we also learn about plants to use for improving indoor air quality. Biology includes overlap in such things as body health and the study of brain anatomy and physiology in psychology. Environmental science is important in such concerns as the sustainable selection of building materials, the disposal of waste, and grey water filtration and recycling. Chemistry includes explorations into why certain cleaners work better than others. What reactions drive an efficient HVAC system to cool and heat the house? Keeping Science at the forefront of STEAM provides a constant reminder to look for teachable moments in the unexpected twists of project based learning.

**Geometry**

Prerequisite: Algebra 1 <br>
Geometry uses deductive reasoning to understand and construct two and three dimensional models. In the practical application of design, computer assisted drafting (CAD) is used to demonstrate proficiency through course exercises. 

**Construction Math**

Mainly practical geometry, engineering, architectural math, and introduction to math needed in electrical and plumbing.

With help from CAD, we design skoolie models with precision that requires a working knowledge of geometry. Calculating electrical and plumbing flows, loads, and capacities requires algebraic understanding, particularly with an off grid house that relies on solar energy. Transferring a scale model of complex roof angles to making the actual cuts requires confidence in the accuracy of mathematic calculations.

**Language Arts**

CCSS for skill development within the context of other classes. E.g., reading technical construction journals, writing lyrics for band using poetic techniques, enhanced with production of dramatic theater. Language instruction integrates Spanish and ASL as might be useful on a construction site. Students read "Spare Parts" by Joshua Davis plus another novel of choice from list at
http://www.oregonbattleofthebooks.org/2017-2018-obob-book-titles/

Thinking is clarified with concise writing and speaking. Each word in each phrase is carefully selected for purposeful communication. Writing is required in every area, e.g., analysis of art, creating content for the website, blog, and social media. Written instructions allow others to replicate and improve on our success. Written communication is also required in unique universal languages such as mathematical reasoning, song composition, scientific formulas and graphics.

**Spanish**

One semester of Spanish is spread throughout the year as each school day starts with a lesson on the Spanish phrases that are to be used that day by students, as per their ability level. Students may test into Spanish I, II, or III for transcribed course content. Students maintain a vocabulary tracker and demonstrate systematic competency in verb tenses. The goal is to effectively communicate with Spanish only speakers on a construction job site. 

**Economics**

The principals of Economics are often discussed using fictional widgets. Conversely, this course uses the very real business of manufactoring and selling a Tiny House. Microeconomic principles of supply and demand, equilibrium, opportunity cost, and elasticity will be addressed. Macroeconomics introduces such topics as sustainable housing on a global scale, cost of energy, and the tradgedy of the commons.

Personal Finance, although introduced, is covered in "Family and Consumer Science" with lessons in credit, debt, savings, and investments.

**Family and Consumer Science (FACS)**

Developing practical, useful skills are motivated by each person's desire to contribute to their community of friends and family.  Skills to be acquired in Family and Consumer Science include everything from knowing how to cook healthy meals and sew curtains, upholstery, to knowing how to earn, save, invest, and spend money. Business practices such as accounting for time and materials in building a tiny house, will transfer into other entrepreneurial endeavors. Skills gained in marketing and sales, and creating a web presence will provide generalized confidence in related business activities. Employment training includes making a resume, applying for FAFSA, and college. 

Student driven curriculum within the broad context of Family and Consumer Science is defined, i.e., [<a href="http://brentn.com/consumer.htm">link</a>]

**Health/PE**

The eight health skills that students will develop are: Concepts, Accessing Information, Self Management, Analyzing Influences, Interpersonal Communication, Goal Setting, Decision Making, and Advocacy.
Productivity is enhanced by a work crew who maintains top physical fitness through exercise and nutrition. As we train our minds through psychological principles, we train our bodies through active implementation of physical education and health. Exercise makes for stronger brains and psychological wellness. MakerTeens are encouraged to participate in school district sports.

**Welding**

In the fall, all students take the first course through Klamath Community College and may continue this pathway toward earning KCC's one-year certificate of completion in welding. Emphasis areas include shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW), flux-cored arc welding (FCAW), oxyacetylene welding and cutting (OAW), and basic fabrication. In the spring, advanced students fabricate a trailer frame for a possible Tiny House build.

**Community Involvement** (40 hours per semester)

8 hours: Tutoring elementary students (Fridays)<br>
8 hours: Interacting with elderly, e.g., checkers, puzzles...<br>
6 hours: Cheering on after school sports and school concerts<br>
6 hours: Student's "push-the-comfort-zone" choice approved by parent/guardian/teacher<br>
6 hours: MAKERTEENS team building weekend activities<br>
3 hours: Cleaning up or improving a public space<br>

**Homework**

To increase individualized learning and promote an active classroom, some classes are "flipped". Students access concise background lectures online as homework, to prepare to demonstrate skills in the classroom. For example, a student will view shop safety videos at home, preparing to pass the safety quiz in the shop. Sections in the students Homework Journal include time spent practicing a band instrument, PE activity log, reading response journal, community involvement, and media tracker.  Websites provided by the Maker Teacher may include: PsychologyLectures.com, WritEnglish.com, MakerBand.com, LearnSTEAM.com, and others.

*Friday*

After *Family and Consumer Science* we volunteer to mentor elementary age children, to be mentored by the elderly, and/or take a field trip to a job shadow work site. We work on the Skoolie if behind schedule, but may also catch up with other projects as may be needed for credit recovery.

*Saturday*

In an effort to create and maintain a supportive family type collegial environment, MAKERTEENS activity pursue healthy weekend activities as a team of consumers and producers. Events may include hikes, sports, concerts, and visits to industries, art galleries, museums or other avenues of inspiration.
