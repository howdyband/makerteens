<p>
Students are encouraged to take all of the following courses in this year of collegial team building under consistent mentorship of a single teacher. However, due to issues of credit recovery in order to stay on track for graduation, a student may exchange out of up to half of the following classes, but must retain commitment to the Tiny house construction, and parental involvement.
</p>
<p>
<b>Tiny House</b><br> - The core career and technical activity is to build a tiny house over the school year. Student teams research, design, and construct a prototype with a materials list for submission to judges. Every student, after passing shop safety tests, helps to build the winning design. Students rotate through the role of crew boss in each phase of construction to meet timelines. Other students document the process in a video blog on our website. The house is sold to cover costs and contribute to next year's project.
</p>
<p>Engineering and building the Tiny House is the vehicle used to display all the participants' growth in other areas. Art, Music, Math, Science, and more join together in this project based experience. The process presents opportunities to experience and direct psychological phenomenon that serve to improve each mind, each character of integrity and perseverance. </p>
<p>
<b>AP Studio Art</b><br> - Ceramics (with wheel and kiln), sculpture, drawing, painting, silk screen, weaving, photography, making decorative items for the Tiny House...
</p>
<p>This is the obvious "A" that transforms STEM into STEAM. Art is the creative expression that adds meaning to other disciplines. </p>
<p>
<b>AP Psychology</b><br> - Included in the curricular scope of psychology are studies  which enable the formation of better study skills, healthier concepts of self, stronger resistance to negative peer influence, and protection from cognitive errors. Students may earn college credit by passing the May exam.
</p>
<p>Far more than an opportunity to be awarded college credit for coursework done in high school, psychology increases the understanding of our internal strengths and weaknesses. This awareness is core to empowering the customization of character, forming beneficial habits that displace harmful habits. Awareness of personality traits allow for revision, addition, and even deletion of traits as students build a reputation.</p>
<p>
<b>Web Design</b><br> - HTML, CSS, PHP, videography for content, documentation of Tiny House program to raise support for material donations.
</p>
<p>
<b>Band</b><br> - Style depends on student interest, ranging from mariachi band to bluegrass to rock. Band performs at the year-end open house party, and other venues if appropriate.
</p>
<p>Making music causes deep and enduring changes to brain structure, more than any other activity, that is legal. Studies show increased neural density of musicians verses non-musicians. This allows for faster and more creative problem solving. Various physiological improvements also increase social richness in communication, toleration, and camaraderie. During the year every student learns to play at least one instrument to a competency of being able to harmonize with accurate syncopation while playing in a group of other musicians. Students learn to read and compose music. Original songs which promote the Tiny House project are performed and published on our website.
</p><p>
<b>Integrated Science</b> <br> - As related to other subjects, such a genetics in the study of traits in psychology, or anatomy and physiology of the nervous system. Physics as related to construction or how instruments produce sounds. Color theory and frequency of light... all based in the skill set advocated by the Next Generation Science Standards.
</p>
<p>Science comes first in the STEAM project based model. Scientific thinking is integrated into every aspect of our alternative high school. Students think critically as they research and evaluate the merits of competing ideas. Students test claims and report their findings in concise written and oral communication. The study of physics is most often the focus as we learn about such things as manipulating waves in art and music, and learning why simple and complex machines make human effort more efficient while we build our tiny house. In biology we learn about the dangers of mold and how to prevent its growth inside the tiny house. Within the category of biology we also learn about plants to use for improving indoor air quality. Biology includes overlap in such things as body health and the study of brain anatomy and physiology in psychology. Environmental science is important in such concerns as the sustainable selection of building materials, the disposal of waste, and grey water filtration and recycling. Chemistry includes explorations into why certain cleaners work better than others. What reactions drive an efficient HVAC system to cool and heat the house? Keeping Science at the forefront of STEAM provides a constant reminder to look for teachable moments in the unexpected twists of project based learning.
</p>
<p>
<b>Construction Math</b><br> - Mainly practical geometry, engineering, architectural math, and introduction to math needed in electrical and plumbing.
</p>
<p>With help from SketchUp, we design Tiny House models with precision that requires a working knowledge of geometry. Calculating electrical and plumbing flows, loads, and capacities requires algebraic understanding, particularly with an off grid house that relies on solar energy. Transferring a scale model of complex roof angles to making the actual cuts requires confidence in the accuracy of mathematic calculations.</p>
<p>
<b>Language Arts</b><br> - CCSS for skill development within the context of other classes. E.g., reading technical construction journals, writing lyrics for band using poetic techniques, enhanced with production of dramatic theater. Also integration of Spanish, and ASL.
</p>
<p>Thinking is clarified with concise writing and speaking. Each word in each phrase is carefully selected for purposeful communication. Writing is required in every area, e.g., analysis of art, creating content for the website, blog, and social media. Written instructions allow others to replicate and improve on our success. Written communication is also required in unique universal languages such as mathematical reasoning, song composition, scientific formulas and graphics.
</p>
<p>
<b>Family and Consumer Science</b><br> - Student driven curriculum within the broad context of Family and Consumer Science as defined, i.e., [<a href="http://brentn.com/consumer.htm">link</a>]
</p>
<p>Developing practical, useful skills are motivated by each person's desire to contribute to their community of friends and family. Although students have not yet met their grandchildren, they can now, everyday, package their self as a gift to that unknown person who they will deeply love. When a person falls in love, they may feel like doing all they can for the beloved. Love songs are full of sacrificial hyperbole and Herculean effort to demonstrate boundless love. Rather than wait for that to happen, each student, each hour, actively packages their life as a gift to those yet unknown persons. Skills to be acquired in Family and Consumer Science include everything from knowing how to cook healthy meals and sew curtains, to knowing how to earn, save, invest, and spend money. Business practices such as accounting for time and materials in building a tiny house, will transfer into other entrepreneurial endeavors. Skills gained in marketing and sales, and creating a web presence will provide generalized confidence in related business activities. Employment training includes making a resume, applying for FAFSA, and college. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Health/PE</b><br> - 
Productivity is enhanced by a work crew who maintains top physical fitness through exercise and nutrition. As we train our minds through psychological principles, we train our bodies through active implementation of physical education and health. Exercise makes for stronger brains and psychological wellness.
</p>
<p>
<b>Community Involvement</b> - (40 hours per semester)<br>
8 hours: Tutoring elementary students (Fridays)<br>
8 hours: Interacting with elderly, e.g., checkers, puzzles...<br>
6 hours: Cheering on after school sports and school concerts<br>
6 hours: Student's "push-the-comfort-zone" choice approved by parent/guardian/teacher<br>
6 hours: MAKERTEENS team building weekend activities<br>
3 hours: Cleaning up or improving a public space<br>

In an effort to create and maintain a supportive family type collegial environment, MAKERTEENS activity pursue healthy weekend activities as a team of consumers and producers. Events may include hikes, sports, concerts, and visits to industries, art galleries, museums or other avenues of inspiration.

Over the course of 36 weeks, approximately 360 hours are set aside for building the Tiny House. If 10 students fully participated every available hour, then 3,600 hours would be expended toward project completion. (One highly skilled journeyman could build the same in about 200 hours.) The excess class time includes training in tool safety, job site safety, practice projects, house design and research, drafting in Sketch-up, learning regulations, and best practices of specialty trades, dealing with the permit process, and taking time for teachable moments related to art, math, science, and psychology. Additionally, the videography team sets up shots and lighting for quality documentation of the process.
