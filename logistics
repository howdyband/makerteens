<strong>Homework</strong>:<br>
It is expected that MAKERTEENS will track daily household chores and music practice. In a type of "flipped class" students are expected to read assignments at home in preparation for class discussions and activities. Most importantly, each student is expected to demonstrate ownership of their individualized, constructivist education, by contributing to our online collaborative forum, reflecting on learning, posing deep questions, suggesting research resources, as we encourage each other in our quest toward healthy minds and habits.

<strong>Grades</strong>:<br>
Timely, authentic, formative feedback is provided with rubrics that vitalize ownership and productive learning. Proficiency based grading allows students to demonstrate competencies in a variety of ways. Portfolios of evidence, industry certificates, and well defined badges, are objective verifications of knowledge and work skills.
