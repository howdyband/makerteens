Career Readiness: Habits of Mind

Researchers and policy makers have tried to elucidate the “habits of mind” needed for success in college and career. Components include demonstration of: being a team player, inquisitive intellectual openness, self advocacy, and the organized ability of productive time management. The work of Arthur Costa (2008) suggests a comprehensive focus on 16 habits of mind:

Persisting
Communicating with clarity and precision
Managing impulsivity (self control)
Gathering data through all senses
Listening with understanding and empathy
Creating, imagining, innovating
Thinking flexibly
Responding with wonderment and awe
Metacognition
Taking responsible risks
Striving for greater accuracy and precision
Finding humor
Questioning and problem posing
Thinking interdependently
Applying past knowledge to new situations
Remaining open to continuous learning

Such habits of mind are directly taught in the psychology class, and encouraged throughout the day’s activities.
