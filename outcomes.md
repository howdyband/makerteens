Career Readiness: Habits of Mind

Researchers and policy makers have tried to elucidate the “habits of mind” needed for success in college and career. Components include demonstration of: being a team player, inquisitive intellectual openness, self advocacy, and the organized ability of productive time management. The work of Arthur Costa (2008) suggests a comprehensive focus on 16 habits of mind:

* Persisting
* Communicating with clarity and precision
* Managing impulsivity (self control)
* Gathering data through all senses
* Listening with understanding and empathy
* Creating, imagining, innovating
* Thinking flexibly
* Responding with wonderment and awe
* Metacognition
* Taking responsible risks
* Striving for greater accuracy and precision
* Finding humor
* Questioning and problem posing
* Thinking interdependently
* Applying past knowledge to new situations
* Remaining open to continuous learning

Such habits of mind are directly taught in the psychology class, and encouraged throughout the day’s activities.
