# Course Scope and Sequence: Geometry Summer Program

**Overview**: This 12-day (6 hours/day, 4 days/week, 3 weeks) course targets high school students who failed geometry, focusing on hands-on applications in woodshop and clay to engage disengaged learners. Weeks 2 and 3 include a 4-week gap for video-based design work.

## Week 1: Foundations of Geometric Design (June 15â€“18)

### Day 1: 2D Geometry in Design & Basic Elements

- **Content**: Course introduction, woodshop safety. Review points, lines, planes, segments, rays. Types of angles (acute, obtuse, right, straight, reflex) and relationships (complementary, supplementary, vertical). Use calipers, protractors for measurement. Design activity: Compare isometric, orthographic, perspective drawings of 3D objects. Design a slanted shelf or clay form with specific angles. Intro to CAD for project ideation.
- **Formulas**:
  - Complementary angles: $$ \angle 1 + \angle 2 = 90^\circ $$
  - Supplementary angles: $$ \angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ $$
  - Vertical angles: $$ \angle 1 = \angle 2 $$
- **Vocabulary**: Point, line, plane, segment, ray, angle (acute, obtuse, right, straight, reflex), complementary, supplementary, vertical, isometric, orthographic, perspective, caliper, protractor.
- **Time**:
  - 1 hr: Intro, safety, basic elements lecture.
  - 1.5 hrs: Angle types/relationships, measurement tools practice.
  - 1.5 hrs: Design activity (drawings, shelf/form design).
  - 2 hrs: CAD intro, project ideation.

### Day 2: 2D Polygons: Triangles, Quadrilaterals, Circles

- **Content**: Properties of triangles (scalene, isosceles, equilateral, right), Triangle Inequality Theorem. Quadrilaterals (parallelogram, rectangle, square, rhombus, trapezoid). Circles: radius, diameter, circumference, area, arcs, chords. Design activity: Create a collage of polygonal/circular objects (e.g., triangular prism shelf, rectangular box) using CAD. Clay slab-building to scale, emphasizing measurement.
- **Formulas**:
  - Triangle area: $$ A = \frac{1}{2}bh $$
  - Rectangle area: $$ A = lw $$
  - Square area: $$ A = s^2 $$
  - Parallelogram area: $$ A = bh $$
  - Trapezoid area: $$ A = \frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h $$
  - Circle circumference: $$ C = 2\pi r $$, $$ C = \pi d $$
  - Circle area: $$ A = \pi r^2 $$
- **Vocabulary**: Scalene, isosceles, equilateral, right triangle, Triangle Inequality Theorem, parallelogram, rectangle, square, rhombus, trapezoid, radius, diameter, circumference, area, arc, chord, tangent, secant.
- **Time**:
  - 1.5 hrs: Lecture/practice on triangles, quadrilaterals, circles.
  - 2 hrs: Design activity (CAD collage, dimensioning).
  - 2.5 hrs: Clay slab-building, measurement.

### Day 12: Project Completion, Presentation, and Reflection

- **Content**: Final project touches. Students present objects, explaining geometric principles (e.g., formulas, symmetry) used in design/construction. Course reflection and feedback. Assessment: Presentation and project evaluation.
- **Formulas**: None new; students reference prior formulas in presentations.
- **Vocabulary**: Presentation, geometric application, reflection.
- **Time**:
  - 1 hr: Final touches.
  - 4 hrs: Presentations (15 min/student, assuming ~16 students).
  - 1 hr: Reflection, feedback.
- **Assessment**: Evaluate projects/presentations on geometric accuracy, creativity/quality, and clarity in explaining principles.
