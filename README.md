### The goals of Oregon's Measure 98 is to "support the needs of students related to engagement, personalization, achievement, and college and career readiness."  

More than a drop-out prevention program, the MAKERTEENS school within a school Career Academy model offers students college credit and career readiness skills as they complete a well rounded curriculum and build a Tiny House in one school year.

* * *

**Proposal**  
Provide a dozen at-risk high school students the opportunity to build a tiny house on a trailer frame. This same MAKERTEENS cadre will be mentored through the following classes: Family and Consumer Science, AP Studio Art, AP Psychology, Web Design, Band, Integrated Science, Language Arts, Health/PE, Construction Math. This well-rounded, project-based, intense mentorship, along with job shadowing in the community, and parent engagement, will effectively move a student toward a diploma, personal success, and job skills. Additionally, students may earn badges and certificates in industry recognized proficiencies.

**Funding**  
Measure 98 provides $800 ($400 as of May 2017) per high school student allocation based on the school district’s Average Daily Membership weighted (ADMw) formula, similar to the State School Fund. After July 1, 2017, districts are invited to submit their biennial plan for raising high school graduation rates through career and technical education programs with college-level educational opportunities.

**Rational for self-contained “school within a school” program**  
Evidence suggests smaller learning communities can boost student achievement, improve attendance rates, decrease disciplinary referrals, and raise self-esteem. (Kemple, 2006)

In the typical 40 hour week workplace, a supervisor manages a group of workers, all day, all week. There is no “falling through the cracks” as one worker shuffles between 5 or more supervisors during a work day like in a large high school. A quietly sullen student could go undetected the full day, a passive-aggressive student could balance a shoulder chip for 50 minutes as the teacher avoided conflict. A class clown could deflect responsibility or feign incompetence for a short disruptive period, with all actors relieved knowing that the gig will soon be up. These practiced behaviors function to evade work. Students at-risk hide in fear of being rejected, covertly pleading to be known and respected an adult. A full day with the same teacher greatly diminishes student ability to smoke screen fears and weaknesses. Although initially painful and time consuming, the results are worth the effort. Under continuous, intensive, relentless care, pretenses fall away, authenticity surfaces, and the whole person can be rehabilitated, in the truest sense of forming beneficial habits.

Additionally, viable cross-curricular project-based learning is more feasible and coherent when delivered by the same individual who strategically integrates learning opportunities within the dynamic flow of group and individual needs. This relevant education, within a positive environment aimed to meet individual needs, will diminish the frequency of students who feel alienated and disengaged from school. A smaller learning community strengthens relationships.

This alternative school provides the IEP team with another possible least restrictive environment (LRE) in their continuum of placement options.

The alternative education teacher is not a lone ranger but is seen as a team member who collaborates by blending RTI (Response to Intervention) and individual PBIS student supports and interventions for students with significant behavioral needs in the wraparound planning process.

**Potential Barriers**:  
A self-contained alternative education program within a traditional school has the intrinsic danger of stigma. Additionally, the risk factors from inappropriate peer associations may be compounded. Disengagement with “normal” school activities can accelerate the tendency to drop out of school. A concentration of impulsive youth with negative attitudes can feed on each other in an escalation of poor behaviors and general rebelliousness. For the uninitiated, being regularly exposed to delinquency may be a gateway to illicit substance abuse, pornography, foul language, and a host of other behaviors in a type of prison yard training ground.  
However, teacher awareness of such potential to downward spiral, empowers the teacher to nip problems in the bud, redirect negative energy, maintain firm expectations and supports for success, and immediately trouble shoot the function of counter-productive behaviors by collaborating with parents, colleagues, and students as appropriate.


MAKERTEENS delineate entrepreneurial plans as employers, prepare resumes as employees, and practice for college admission interviews in order to effectively thrive in any potential contingency. Above-all, MAKERTEENS are trained to grade themselves along their quest to package their lives as a gift to their current and future friends, family, and community. In the process of life, grades on extrinsic behaviors cannot accurately approximate the true value of intrinsic habits of mind.

**Career Readiness: Habits of Mind**  
Researchers and policy makers have tried to elucidate the “habits of mind” needed for success in college and career. Components include demonstration of: being a team player, inquisitive intellectual openness, self advocacy, and the organized ability of productive time management. The work of Arthur Costa (2008) suggests a comprehensive focus on 16 habits of mind:  

*   Persisting
*   Communicating with clarity and precision
*   Managing impulsivity (self control)
*   Gathering data through all senses
*   Listening with understanding and empathy
*   Creating, imagining, innovating
*   Thinking flexibly
*   Responding with wonderment and awe
*   Metacognition
*   Taking responsible risks
*   Striving for greater accuracy and precision
*   Finding humor
*   Questioning and problem posing
*   Thinking interdependently
*   Applying past knowledge to new situations
*   Remaining open to continuous learning

Such habits of mind are directly taught in the psychology class, and encouraged throughout the day’s activities.

**Schedule**: 7 hours of class time per day  
(e.g., 8am-4pm with time off for breaks and lunch)  
M/W:  
AP Studio Art (2 hrs)  
AP Psychology (1 hr)  
Web Design (1 hr)  
Tiny House (3 hrs)  

Tu/Th:  
Band (1 hr)  
Language Arts (2 hrs)  
Construction Math (1 hr)  
Health/PE (1 hr)  
Integrated Science (2 hrs)

Friday:  
Family and Consumer science (2 hrs)  
Tiny House (4 hours, more or less to keep on schedule)  
Catch-up on projects, credit recovery, career planning, job shadow and reports, field trips to other work sites, etc.

Saturday:  
In an effort to create and maintain a supportive family type collegial environment, MAKERTEENS activitly pursue healthy weekend activities as a team of consumers and producers. Events may include hikes, sports, concerts, and visits to industries, art galleries, museums or other avenues of inspiration.

Over the course of 36 weeks, approximately 360 hours are set aside for building the Tiny House. If 10 students fully participated every available hour, then 3,600 hours would be expended toward project completion. (One highly skilled journeyman could build the same in about 200 hours.) The excess class time includes training in tool safety, job site safety, practice projects, house design and research, drafting in Sketch-up, learning regulations, and best practices of specialty trades, dealing with the permit process, and taking time for teachable moments related to art, math, science, and psychology. Additionally, the videography team sets up shots and lighting for quality documentation.

**Program Expenses**:  

Total cost for this two-year program is $248k  
(Annual cost of $124k divided by $800 per student would require 155 students in grades 9-12\. If the ADMw is lower, or other CTE programs need funding, then the 2018 Summer Program could be cut back accordingly.)

2017-2018 : $135k  
$78k for teacher salary*, +6% ($4680) contribution toward PERS, and district's group insurance.  
$52k for materials and supplies  
$0 for tools (teacher has all required tools and instruments for students to use in construction, band instruments to loan, and ceramic studio equipment (kiln, wheel, pug mill, extruder). Teacher has a 29 foot enclosed mobile shop but would need a classroom and secure covered space for the build.

Summer 2018 : $30k  
Six students who have demonstrated valued work ethic, academic achievement, and marketable skills during the school year are invited to work on a building project earning $15 hour. Cost for staff is at $45 per hour. A labor total of $30k equates to 222 hours toward a community improvement project, e.g., building a gazebo to donate to the Farmer's Market. (If funded, this summer program would be run through a non-profit for tax purposes.)

2018 - 2019 : $83k  
Cost of Human Resources remain the same as 2017-18  
Cost of materials is $0 based on sale of the 2017 - 18 tiny house.  

*Salary is based on the Gresham-Barlow School District salary table for education and years of experience. Teacher delivers 10 unique classes per week with no prep period.

note:  
A high school drop out not only removes their state funding from a district, but also represents a half-million dollar tax loss to a community and state over a lifetime, and likely increases taxpayer expenses to pay for the dropout’s health, welfare, and incarceration. (Economist Russell Rumberger, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara and director of the California Dropout Research Project)

Accountability  

In addition to itemizing time and expenses as per state requirements, student progress toward program goals is regularly assessed. Data which identified an at-risk student, such as truancy, low grades, and office referrals, are collected and evaluated. Baseline data is provided by those who are aware of student history and likely trajectory without effective intervention. In collaboration with the school counselor, administrator, parent, and community services, individualized outcomes are identified, tracked, and reported.

The U.S. Department of Education defines an alternative education school as ”a public elementary/secondary school that addresses the needs of students which typically cannot be met in a regular school and provides nontraditional education which is not categorized solely as regular education, special education, vocational education, gifted and talented or magnet school programs” (U.S. Department of Education, 2002, p. 55).
