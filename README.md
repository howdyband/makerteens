## The following is a DRAFT PROPOSAL of the MAKERTEENS program
### The goals of Oregon's Measure 98 is to "support the needs of students related to engagement, personalization, achievement, and college and career readiness."  

More than a drop-out prevention program, the MAKERTEENS school within a school Career Academy model offers students college credit and career readiness skills as they complete a well rounded curriculum and build a Tiny House in one school year.

* * *

**Proposal**  
Provide a dozen at-risk high school students the opportunity to build a tiny house on a trailer frame. This same MAKERTEENS cadre will be mentored through the following classes: Family and Consumer Science, AP Studio Art, AP Psychology, Web Design, Band, Integrated Science, Language Arts, Health/PE, Construction Math. This well-rounded, project-based, intense mentorship, along with job shadowing in the community, and parent engagement, will effectively move a student toward a diploma, personal success, and job skills. Additionally, students may earn badges and certificates in industry recognized proficiencies.

**Funding**  
Measure 98 provides $800 ($400 as of May 2017) per high school student allocation based on the school district’s Average Daily Membership weighted (ADMw) formula, similar to the State School Fund. After July 1, 2017, districts are invited to submit their biennial plan for raising high school graduation rates through career and technical education programs with college-level educational opportunities.

**Courses**

Students are encouraged to take all of the following courses in this year of collegial team building under consistent mentorship of a single teacher. However, due to issues of credit recovery in order to stay on track for graduation, a student may exchange out of up to half of the following classes, but must retain commitment to the Tiny house construction, and parental involvement.

**Tiny House**  
- The core career and technical activity is to build a tiny house over the school year. Student teams research, design, and construct a prototype with a materials list for submission to judges. Every student, after passing shop safety tests, helps to build the winning design. Students rotate through the role of crew boss in each phase of construction to meet timelines. Other students document the process in a video blog on our website. The house is sold to cover costs and contribute to next year's project.

Engineering and building the Tiny House is the vehicle used to display all the participants' growth in other areas. Art, Music, Math, Science, and more join together in this project based experience. The process presents opportunities to experience and direct psychological phenomenon that serve to improve each mind, each character of integrity and perseverance.

**AP Studio Art**  
- Ceramics (with wheel and kiln), sculpture, drawing, painting, silk screen, weaving, photography, making decorative items for the Tiny House...

This is the obvious "A" that transforms STEM into STEAM. Art is the creative expression that adds meaning to other disciplines.

**AP Psychology**  
- Included in the curricular scope of psychology are studies which enable the formation of better study skills, healthier concepts of self, stronger resistance to negative peer influence, and protection from cognitive errors. Students may earn college credit by passing the May exam.

Far more than an opportunity to be awarded college credit for coursework done in high school, psychology increases the understanding of our internal strengths and weaknesses. This awareness is core to empowering the customization of character, forming beneficial habits that displace harmful habits. Awareness of personality traits allow for revision, addition, and even deletion of traits as students build a reputation.

**Web Design**  
- HTML, CSS, PHP, videography for content, documentation of Tiny House program to raise support for material donations.

**Band**  
- Style depends on student interest, ranging from mariachi band to bluegrass to rock. Band performs at the year-end open house party, and other venues if appropriate.

Making music causes deep and enduring changes to brain structure, more than any other activity, that is legal. Studies show increased neural density of musicians verses non-musicians. This allows for faster and more creative problem solving. Various physiological improvements also increase social richness in communication, toleration, and camaraderie. During the year every student learns to play at least one instrument to a competency of being able to harmonize with accurate syncopation while playing in a group of other musicians. Students learn to read and compose music. Original songs which promote the Tiny House project are performed and published on our website.

**Integrated Science**  
- As related to other subjects, such a genetics in the study of traits in psychology, or anatomy and physiology of the nervous system. Physics as related to construction or how instruments produce sounds. Color theory and frequency of light... all based in the skill set advocated by the Next Generation Science Standards.

Science comes first in the STEAM project based model. Scientific thinking is integrated into every aspect of our alternative high school. Students think critically as they research and evaluate the merits of competing ideas. Students test claims and report their findings in concise written and oral communication. The study of physics is most often the focus as we learn about such things as manipulating waves in art and music, and learning why simple and complex machines make human effort more efficient while we build our tiny house. In biology we learn about the dangers of mold and how to prevent its growth inside the tiny house. Within the category of biology we also learn about plants to use for improving indoor air quality. Biology includes overlap in such things as body health and the study of brain anatomy and physiology in psychology. Environmental science is important in such concerns as the sustainable selection of building materials, the disposal of waste, and grey water filtration and recycling. Chemistry includes explorations into why certain cleaners work better than others. What reactions drive an efficient HVAC system to cool and heat the house? Keeping Science at the forefront of STEAM provides a constant reminder to look for teachable moments in the unexpected twists of project based learning.

**Construction Math**  
- Mainly practical geometry, engineering, architectural math, and introduction to math needed in electrical and plumbing.

With help from SketchUp, we design Tiny House models with precision that requires a working knowledge of geometry. Calculating electrical and plumbing flows, loads, and capacities requires algebraic understanding, particularly with an off grid house that relies on solar energy. Transferring a scale model of complex roof angles to making the actual cuts requires confidence in the accuracy of mathematic calculations.

**Language Arts**  
- CCSS for skill development within the context of other classes. E.g., reading technical construction journals, writing lyrics for band using poetic techniques, enhanced with production of dramatic theater. Also integration of Spanish, and ASL.

Thinking is clarified with concise writing and speaking. Each word in each phrase is carefully selected for purposeful communication. Writing is required in every area, e.g., analysis of art, creating content for the website, blog, and social media. Written instructions allow others to replicate and improve on our success. Written communication is also required in unique universal languages such as mathematical reasoning, song composition, scientific formulas and graphics.

**Family and Consumer Science**  
- Student driven curriculum within the broad context of Family and Consumer Science as defined, i.e., [[link](http://brentn.com/consumer.htm)]

Developing practical, useful skills are motivated by each person's desire to contribute to their community of friends and family. Although students have not yet met their grandchildren, they can now, everyday, package their self as a gift to that unknown person who they will deeply love. When a person falls in love, they may feel like doing all they can for the beloved. Love songs are full of sacrificial hyperbole and Herculean effort to demonstrate boundless love. Rather than wait for that to happen, each student, each hour, actively packages their life as a gift to those yet unknown persons. Skills to be acquired in Family and Consumer Science include everything from knowing how to cook healthy meals and sew curtains, to knowing how to earn, save, invest, and spend money. Business practices such as accounting for time and materials in building a tiny house, will transfer into other entrepreneurial endeavors. Skills gained in marketing and sales, and creating a web presence will provide generalized confidence in related business activities. Employment training includes making a resume, applying for FAFSA, and college.

**Health/PE**  
- Productivity is enhanced by a work crew who maintains top physical fitness through exercise and nutrition. As we train our minds through psychological principles, we train our bodies through active implementation of physical education and health. Exercise makes for stronger brains and psychological wellness.

**Community Involvement** - (40 hours per semester)  
8 hours: Tutoring elementary students (Fridays)  
8 hours: Interacting with elderly, e.g., checkers, puzzles...  
6 hours: Cheering on after school sports and school concerts  
6 hours: Student's "push-the-comfort-zone" choice approved by parent/guardian/teacher  
6 hours: MAKERTEENS team building weekend activities  
3 hours: Cleaning up or improving a public space  

* * *

**Homework**:  
It is expected that MAKERTEENS will track daily household chores and music practice. In a type of "flipped class" students are expected to read assignments at home in preparation for class discussions and activities. Most importantly, each student is expected to demonstrate ownership of their individualized, constructivist education, by contributing to our online collaborative forum, reflecting on learning, posing deep questions, suggesting research resources, as we encourage each other in our quest toward healthy minds and habits.

**Grades**:  
Timely, authentic, formative feedback is provided with rubrics that vitalize ownership and productive learning. Proficiency based grading allows students to demonstrate competencies in a variety of ways. Portfolios of evidence, industry certificates, and well defined badges, are objective verifications of knowledge and work skills.

MAKERTEENS delineate entrepreneurial plans as employers, prepare resumes as employees, and practice for college admission interviews in order to effectively thrive in any potential contingency. Above-all, MAKERTEENS are trained to grade themselves along their quest to package their lives as a gift to their current and future friends, family, and community. In the process of life, grades on extrinsic behaviors cannot accurately approximate the true value of intrinsic habits of mind.

**Rational for self-contained “school within a school” program**  
Evidence suggests smaller learning communities can boost student achievement, improve attendance rates, decrease disciplinary referrals, and raise self-esteem. (Kemple, 2006)

In the typical 40 hour week workplace, a supervisor manages a group of workers, all day, all week. There is no “falling through the cracks” as one worker shuffles between 5 or more supervisors during a work day like in a large high school. A quietly sullen student could go undetected the full day, a passive-aggressive student could balance a shoulder chip for 50 minutes as the teacher avoided conflict. A class clown could deflect responsibility or feign incompetence for a short disruptive period, with all actors relieved knowing that the gig will soon be up. These practiced behaviors function to evade work. Students at-risk hide in fear of being rejected, covertly pleading to be known and respected an adult. A full day with the same teacher greatly diminishes student ability to smoke screen fears and weaknesses. Although initially painful and time consuming, the results are worth the effort. Under continuous, intensive, relentless care, pretenses fall away, authenticity surfaces, and the whole person can be rehabilitated, in the truest sense of forming beneficial habits.

Additionally, viable cross-curricular project-based learning is more feasible and coherent when delivered by the same individual who strategically integrates learning opportunities within the dynamic flow of group and individual needs. This relevant education, within a positive environment aimed to meet individual needs, will diminish the frequency of students who feel alienated and disengaged from school. A smaller learning community strengthens relationships.

This alternative school provides the IEP team with another possible least restrictive environment (LRE) in their continuum of placement options.

The alternative education teacher is not a lone ranger but is seen as a team member who collaborates by blending RTI (Response to Intervention) and individual PBIS student supports and interventions for students with significant behavioral needs in the wraparound planning process.

**Potential Barriers**:  
A self-contained alternative education program within a traditional school has the intrinsic danger of stigma. Additionally, the risk factors from inappropriate peer associations may be compounded. Disengagement with “normal” school activities can accelerate the tendency to drop out of school. A concentration of impulsive youth with negative attitudes can feed on each other in an escalation of poor behaviors and general rebelliousness. For the uninitiated, being regularly exposed to delinquency may be a gateway to illicit substance abuse, pornography, foul language, and a host of other behaviors in a type of prison yard training ground.  
However, teacher awareness of such potential to downward spiral, empowers the teacher to nip problems in the bud, redirect negative energy, maintain firm expectations and supports for success, and immediately trouble shoot the function of counter-productive behaviors by collaborating with parents, colleagues, and students as appropriate.

**Rules**:  
Students must abide by school's student code handbook in order to remain in the program. However, when permitted, peer- mediated interventions to student infractions follow the model of restorative justice. Clear expectations and self-monitoring tools assist students to avoid detrimental triggers and increase skills in conflict resolution.

**Career Readiness: Habits of Mind**  
Researchers and policy makers have tried to elucidate the “habits of mind” needed for success in college and career. Components include demonstration of: being a team player, inquisitive intellectual openness, self advocacy, and the organized ability of productive time management. The work of Arthur Costa (2008) suggests a comprehensive focus on 16 habits of mind:  

*   Persisting
*   Communicating with clarity and precision
*   Managing impulsivity (self control)
*   Gathering data through all senses
*   Listening with understanding and empathy
*   Creating, imagining, innovating
*   Thinking flexibly
*   Responding with wonderment and awe
*   Metacognition
*   Taking responsible risks
*   Striving for greater accuracy and precision
*   Finding humor
*   Questioning and problem posing
*   Thinking interdependently
*   Applying past knowledge to new situations
*   Remaining open to continuous learning

Such habits of mind are directly taught in the psychology class, and encouraged throughout the day’s activities.

**Schedule**: 7 hours of class time per day  
(e.g., 8am-4pm with time off for breaks and lunch)  
M/W:  
AP Studio Art (2 hrs)  
AP Psychology (1 hr)  
Web Design (1 hr)  
Tiny House (3 hrs)  

Tu/Th:  
Band (1 hr)  
Language Arts (2 hrs)  
Construction Math (1 hr)  
Health/PE (1 hr)  
Integrated Science (2 hrs)

Friday:  
Family and Consumer science (2 hrs)  
Tiny House (4 hours, more or less to keep on schedule)  
Catch-up on projects, credit recovery, career planning, job shadow and reports, field trips to other work sites, etc.

Saturday:  
In an effort to create and maintain a supportive family type collegial environment, MAKERTEENS activitly pursue healthy weekend activities as a team of consumers and producers. Events may include hikes, sports, concerts, and visits to industries, art galleries, museums or other avenues of inspiration.

Over the course of 36 weeks, approximately 360 hours are set aside for building the Tiny House. If 10 students fully participated every available hour, then 3,600 hours would be expended toward project completion. (One highly skilled journeyman could build the same in about 200 hours.) The excess class time includes training in tool safety, job site safety, practice projects, house design and research, drafting in Sketch-up, learning regulations, and best practices of specialty trades, dealing with the permit process, and taking time for teachable moments related to art, math, science, and psychology. Additionally, the videography team sets up shots and lighting for quality documentation.

**Student Qualifications**  
Any student entering grade 9 - 12 may apply with the understanding that selection is prioritize to "serve those students identified by the school district as most at-risk of not graduating or being college or career ready, historically and traditionally marginalized and historically underrepresented". Current dropouts, age 20 or younger, may also apply. Ten to fourteen successful applicants will have recommendations from two school staff members. Students may not repeat this opportunity in a subsequent year.

Often students at risk of dropping out have experienced Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), toxic stress, and other dysfunctional contexts that have negatively impacted brain development. Fortunately, with intensive care and retraining, the plasticity of the adolescent brain can grow health promoting neural pathways while allowing bad habits of mind to be pruned away. Students willing to contractually commit to the demands of the MAKERTEENS program are ideal candidates. A student needs a willingness to stick with selected classes and activities throughout the school year. Contracts are signed so parents and students fully understand their rigorous commitments.

Students with severe emotional/behavioral disorders and/or chronic aggressive behaviors, are not categorically disallowed to apply. However, due to the necessity for vigilant shop safety, including working with power tools, it would be problematic for unsafe students to remain in the program.

High achieving students, although rare, may also display at-risk factors such as sporadic school attendance and/or disengagement from extra-curricular school events.

**Parent Qualifications**  

Parents are uniquely qualified to inform the teacher of “wraparound” issues at home and in the community. In order for their teen to be in the program, parent(s) (or guardian) need to commit to monthly meetings where we discuss parenting issues. Additionally, each parent would need to make time to randomly visit at least one hour of class per month. In the “Check and Connect” model, adults make frequent time to proactively acknowledge students positive behaviors, rather than primarily reacting to student misbehaviors. The resulting authentic praise promotes healthy communicating relationships.

* * *

**Program Expenses**:  

Total cost for this two-year program is $248k  
(Annual cost of $124k divided by $800 per student would require 155 students in grades 9-12\. If the ADMw is lower, or other CTE programs need funding, then the 2018 Summer Program could be cut back accordingly.)

2017-2018 : $135k  
$78k for teacher salary*, +6% ($4680) contribution toward PERS, and district's group insurance.  
$52k for materials and supplies  
$0 for tools (teacher has all required tools and instruments for students to use in construction, band instruments to loan, and ceramic studio equipment (kiln, wheel, pug mill, extruder). Teacher has a 29 foot enclosed mobile shop but would need a classroom and secure covered space for the build.

Summer 2018 : $30k  
Six students who have demonstrated valued work ethic, academic achievement, and marketable skills during the school year are invited to work on a building project earning $15 hour. Cost for staff is at $45 per hour. A labor total of $30k equates to 222 hours toward a community improvement project, e.g., building a gazebo to donate to the Farmer's Market. (If funded, this summer program would be run through a non-profit for tax purposes.)

2018 - 2019 : $83k  
Cost of Human Resources remain the same as 2017-18  
Cost of materials is $0 based on sale of the 2017 - 18 tiny house.  

*Salary is based on the Gresham-Barlow School District salary table for education and years of experience. Teacher delivers 10 unique classes per week with no prep period.

note:  
A high school drop out not only removes their state funding from a district, but also represents a half-million dollar tax loss to a community and state over a lifetime, and likely increases taxpayer expenses to pay for the dropout’s health, welfare, and incarceration. (Economist Russell Rumberger, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara and director of the California Dropout Research Project)

Accountability  

In addition to itemizing time and expenses as per state requirements, student progress toward program goals is regularly assessed. Data which identified an at-risk student, such as truancy, low grades, and office referrals, are collected and evaluated. Baseline data is provided by those who are aware of student history and likely trajectory without effective intervention. In collaboration with the school counselor, administrator, parent, and community services, individualized outcomes are identified, tracked, and reported.

The U.S. Department of Education defines an alternative education school as ”a public elementary/secondary school that addresses the needs of students which typically cannot be met in a regular school and provides nontraditional education which is not categorized solely as regular education, special education, vocational education, gifted and talented or magnet school programs” (U.S. Department of Education, 2002, p. 55).
